Get a hugo blog working using the quickstart guide. Add a theme. I chose Anatole, but there were several to choose from. Configure the core repo in github. Figure out hosting on github pages Figure out how the build setup works. It&amp;rsquo;s documented at a level above my understanding, so took a bit of time to figure out.</description></item></channel></rss>
