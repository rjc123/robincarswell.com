Hard luck.</h3></div><p>To replace a really old Denon that finally gave up the ghost, a few years ago I bought myself a Yamaha VX-R675. It&rsquo;s great &ndash; I can tune into the radio, listening to that great legacy media without dealing with retargeted ads that keep pummelling me with the same ad for something I already own. #surveillancecapitalism</p><p>It has this great feature called &ldquo;Net Radio&rdquo; included in the device, allowing access to the world of internet radio.</p><p><strong>THE FUTURE IS NOW.</strong></p><hr><p>But then, the radio service that they rely on to support that feature <a href=https://europe.yamaha.com/en/support/internet_radio_station_access_issues/index.html>changed its business model</a>. The press release is a triumph of modern truthiness PR. <em>(italicised edits for clarity, mine)</em></p><blockquote><p><strong>Internet Radio Station Access Issues</strong></p><p>Currently, Yamaha products with internet radio streaming capabilities provided by vTuner are having difficulties with accessing the streaming service. Here are the current details that Yamaha has recognized so far:</p><p>A customer may see a message saying, &ldquo;See yradio.vtuner.com for more info about vTuner&rsquo;s full access.&rdquo; on user interfaces of Yamaha products or even may hear it through audio playback. This links to a message that states, &ldquo;to be able to receive full access to vTuner&rsquo;s service, we [vTuner] would like to ask you for a small contribution of $3 a year. All contributions will be used solely to support the vTuner service.&rdquo;</p><p>The message provided on screen or via audio is delivered by vTuner, and Yamaha does not endorse the performance of the paid service offered by the vendor <em>we selected to include in your device</em>.</p><p>Yamaha supports many streaming services <em>rather than picking a single approach</em>. Each one of the services may change its business model at any time, which is independent of Yamaha and outside our area of control <em>and we didn&rsquo;t consider this when designing our approach to this feature category or technology for inclusion in our product line</em>.</p><p>As announced in March 2019, the free internet radio service supported on <em>some</em> Yamaha products has been switched from vTuner to airable.radio via a firmware update on select models to ensure access to free internet radio stations <em>possibly creating a future problem when airable also adjusts its business model</em>.</p><p>Please note: once this firmware is applied, all vTuner bookmarks and added stations will become inaccessible from your Yamaha products <em>reducing the value of the device we sold you</em>.</p><p>Some models are incompatible with the available Airable firmware update that could provide a direct replacement for the vTuner internet radio station access to ensure future connectivity. <em>If you want this feature, we suggest you junk your device and buy a new one from one of our competitors.</em> Internet radio station access is subject to the availability and functionality of the original internet radio service provider, vTuner, for the following models:</p><p>INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE FIRMWARE UPDATE: <strong>A long list of devices, including mine</strong></p><p><a href=https://europe.yamaha.com/en/news_events/2019/0305_av_update_on_internet_radio_station_access.html>Learn more about the firmware update here.</a></p></blockquote><p>As a technologist, I can see why all these legacy electronics companies are getting eaten by the modern players. The problem:</p><ul><li>Because they don&rsquo;t think about their brands / customers and the long term future of their devices in the home</li><li>The strategy is about shipping more boxes, rather than shipping fewer sustainably</li></ul><p>The solution is pretty straightforward:</p><ul><li>Simplify the on-device user interface for every device on this list to play say 1-5 netradio streams</li><li>Update the domain in the firmware to netradio.yamaha.com</li><li>Put in place a translation to a net radio service of your choice</li><li>Control which stream plays in your new Yamaha streaming service dashboard</li></ul><p><strong>AND GET IN THE MODERN AUDIO GAME</strong> As it is, Yamaha is out of my consideration set.</p></div><div class=post-footer><div class=info></div></div></div></div></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=/js/medium-zoom.min.44288fd315b6cda68c1f4743caad56535c0f81a5b5a672f385e82b3896575c1d.js integrity="sha256-RCiP0xW2zaaMH0dDyq1WU1wPgaW1pnLzhegrOJZXXB0=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-9F57FFB75P"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-9F57FFB75P")</script></body></html>
