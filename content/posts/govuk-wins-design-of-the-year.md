For the past several months, I've been working on building out [gov.uk](https://gov.uk). More precisely, the Inside Government team, working up new product development and content transition. 

I've come a cross a ton of great reads on the site.

- https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/individual-reporting-requirements -for-sheep-and-goats 
- https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foi-ref-1015-12
- https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/establishing-stability-in-afghanistan (they've subsequently [updated the URL](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2010-to-2015-government-policy-afghanistan/2010-to-2015-government-policy-afghanistan))

It's really kind of revolutionary that a government has actually written down its policy on a controversial topic in a way that a human can understand. *[edit: Unfortunately, that practice didn't last beyond that one government.]*

Here's what some other people have said about the thing:

> **The Rt Hon David Cameron**
> 'I am delighted that the GOV.UK website has won the Design of The Year award in 2013.
> This government is committed to being the most transparent in the world. For the first time, people can find out what's happening inside government, all in one place, and in a clear and consistent format. 
> It is just another example of Britain's world class design talent standing out on the global stage; in this case helping to enhance the modern relationship between the public and government.' 
 
> **Deyan Sudjic, Director of Design Museum**
> 'GOV.UK looks elegant, and subtly British thanks to a revised version of a classic typeface, designed by Margaret Calvert back in the 1960s. 
> It is the Paul Smith of websites. The rest of the world is deeply impressed, and because it has rationalised multiple official websites, it saves the taxpayer millions, what's not to like?... 
> ...GOV.UK is a remarkable success on so many levels. It makes life better for millions of people coping with the everyday chores, from getting a new passport, to paying their taxes. 
> It's a reflection of the government understanding how to communicate with the country in a way that works, it's simple, direct, well mannered, all the things that we would like to take for granted from the government, but in a sea of red tape and jargon, usually can't.' 

> **@benedictbrogan**
> Anyone developing a digital strategy needs to study the remarkable success of gov.uk, winner of design of the year

All in all, a pretty satisfying professional experience.
