To replace a really old Denon that finally gave up the ghost, a few years ago I bought myself a Yamaha VX-R675. It's great -- I can tune into the radio, listening to that great legacy media without dealing with retargeted ads that keep pummelling me with the same ad for something I already own. #surveillancecapitalism

It has this great feature called "Net Radio" included in the device, allowing access to the world of internet radio. 

**THE FUTURE IS NOW.**

--------

But then, the radio service that they rely on to support that feature [changed its business model](https://europe.yamaha.com/en/support/internet_radio_station_access_issues/index.html). The press release is a triumph of modern truthiness PR. *(italicised edits for clarity, mine)*

> **Internet Radio Station Access Issues**
>
> Currently, Yamaha products with internet radio streaming capabilities provided by vTuner are having difficulties with accessing the streaming service. Here are the current details that Yamaha has recognized so far:
> 
> A customer may see a message saying, "See yradio.vtuner.com for more info about vTuner's full access." on user interfaces of Yamaha products or even may hear it through audio playback. This links to a message that states, "to be able to receive full access to vTuner's service, we [vTuner] would like to ask you for a small contribution of $3 a year. All contributions will be used solely to support the vTuner service."
> 
> The message provided on screen or via audio is delivered by vTuner, and Yamaha does not endorse the performance of the paid service offered by the vendor *we selected to include in your device*.
> 
> Yamaha supports many streaming services *rather than picking a single approach*. Each one of the services may change its business model at any time, which is independent of Yamaha and outside our area of control *and we didn't consider this when designing our approach to this feature category or technology for inclusion in our product line*.
> 
> As announced in March 2019, the free internet radio service supported on *some* Yamaha products has been switched from vTuner to airable.radio via a firmware update on select models to ensure access to free internet radio stations *possibly creating a future problem when airable also adjusts its business model*.
> 
> Please note: once this firmware is applied, all vTuner bookmarks and added stations will become inaccessible from your Yamaha products *reducing the value of the device we sold you*. 
> 
> Some models are incompatible with the available Airable firmware update that could provide a direct replacement for the vTuner internet radio station access to ensure future connectivity. *If you want this feature, we suggest you junk your device and buy a new one from one of our competitors.* Internet radio station access is subject to the availability and functionality of the original internet radio service provider, vTuner, for the following models:
> 
> INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE FIRMWARE UPDATE: **A long list of devices, including mine**

As a technologist, I can see why all these legacy electronics companies are getting eaten by the modern players. The problem:

* Because they don't think about their brands / customers and the long term future of their devices in the home
* The strategy is about shipping more boxes, rather than shipping fewer sustainably

The solution is pretty straightforward:

* Simplify the on-device user interface for every device on this list to play say 1-5 netradio streams 
* Update the domain in the firmware to netradio.yamaha.com
* Put in place a translation to a net radio service of your choice
* Control which stream plays in your new Yamaha streaming service dashboard

**AND GET IN THE MODERN AUDIO GAME** As it is, Yamaha is out of my consideration set.
