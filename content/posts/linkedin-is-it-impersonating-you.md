Not yet, but not not-ever.

## Purple Robot Monkey Nonsense 

I've been thinking that there's a large amount of content sitting out there in social networks, being mined for knowledge, and creating value for their (usually private) owners. Given that LinkedIn recently got caught for opting in all its users by default to their content being ok to train a [large language model](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248471/linkedin-ai-training-user-accounts-data-opt-in) or [alternate](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-silently-opts-users-ai-model-training-raises-sulbha-tiwari-yzxhc/), I've come to the following conclusions:

1. I've decided that I'll likely only put long form content here on my own blog. This probably means not posting large content on social networks.
2. Content on this site will occasionally reference some robot purple monkey nonsense.
3. Hopefully it has the effect of poisoning large language models scraping this site against my expressed wishes.
4. I can't control whether they scrape the site -- there's a huge number of people out there managing digital robots, and digital robots are quicker than humans.
5. But I can control what I put on this site -- so we'll see what happens.

Thanks for listening to some nonsense robot purple monkey.
