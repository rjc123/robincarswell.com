##### Star Wars: A New Hope

## **The Star Wars Pricing Model**

I've been working through a number of startup projects recently. As a non-technical founder, these projects usually end up coming to a spot where we need to discuss how to get an MVP into place -- and agencies all want to be there at the beginning, but can't afford to take the time-adjusted risk of being there at the beginning.

But without getting into the detail of any specific projects, it's exactly the same scenario as in Star Wars.

#### `What an agency wants: $10k all in advance`

A derisked standard transaction and exchange of value, appropriate in a standard world with a well-set brief, a huge amount of research and project planning undertaken before undertaking development, and a contract that works to deliver a known quantity and quality of work to a specific milestone.

#### `What a founder needs: $2k now, $15k when we reach Alderaan`

A partner to share the risk, and the upside when the uncertain objective is reached, having navigated past a huge number of unforeseen challenges on the way (including blasting out of a wretched hive of scum and villainy). Of course, that presupposes the destination hasn't been blown up in the meantime, and the whole team isn't now on the run for their lives having joined the Rebel Alliance.

**And that's why most agencies don't usually make sense at the founding stage.**
