Just a round-up of the stationery I normally buy to help in professional contexts.

* [Sticky Notes](https://amzn.to/3y1QJwu): No good technology team can do their job without them. 
* [Markers](https://amzn.to/3w37Jkt): The companion to your sticky notes. 
* [Pens](https://amzn.to/3tIDrSw): The right pen can make all the difference. 
* [Notebooks](https://amzn.to/33A7QHK): With every pen you need paper. 
* [Storage](https://amzn.to/3jm2l8I): A place to keep it all

And if you want a kanban project plan that turns this idea into an extremely small microbusiness check out [this trello board](https://trello.com/b/M4VLQdWv). I didn't build it, mainly because of its tiny business model...but it was a good thought experiment, and would be a good supporting / business development product to go alongside a consultancy specialising in the topic.
