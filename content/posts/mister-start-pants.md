## What the heck do you mean?

When I was young and early in the internet, and before social media destroyed the fabric of the world, I used to read a blog called [Mister Pants](https://misterpants.com). The author doesn't write very much any longer, probably due to the three year old he mentions in his last post....or he's switched mediums.

In the site, he made [his own start page](https://misterpants.com/start)

## Yeah, but so what?

I stole his and [made my own Canadian version](/misterSTARTpants.htm). 

And today, I've [remade a hack of it](/start.htm) so I can switch my local homepage away from Google. 

## But why?

My view: 

* in today's world, it's really important that you can switch your behaviours and tools.
* Otherwise, you fall into habit traps and stagnate, 
* and businesses with oligopoly power can feel free to raise prices, lower quality and [continue to enshittify](https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/04/teach-me-how-to-shruggie/) the world.
* Just do it yourself, and don't forget to own your own namespace.
