I took the time to get [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) set up to replace my long neglected personal blog. Here's a roundup of the experience, and some notes for future reference.

It was pretty straightforward and (aside from all the effort to port the content) only took a few hours following some (generally understandable) blog guidance.

1. Get a hugo blog working using the [quickstart guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).
2. Add a theme. I chose [Anatole](https://themes.gohugo.io/anatole/), but there were several to choose from.
3. Configure the [core repo](https://github.com/rjc123/robincarswell.com) in github.
4. Figure out hosting on [github pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)
5. Figure out how the [build setup](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo) works. It's documented at a level above my understanding, so took a bit of time to figure out. [This blog post](https://medium.com/zendesk-engineering/a-github-actions-workflow-to-generate-publish-your-hugo-website-f36375e56cf7) helped.
6. Write (and then update) [this blog post](/posts/getting-started-with-hugo/).
7. [Still to do] Get all the historical content in shape. No wonder I'm stalled here.
8. [Still to do] Set up the domain.

For a lot of people, this post itself might seem pretty simplistic. It is. I'm really just writing this for one person, "Future Robin" -- because he's not nearly as knowledgeable about this setup as I am.
