It was pretty straightforward and (aside from all the content port effort) took a few hours and some free tools.

1. Get a hugo blog working using the [quickstart guide]().
2. Add a theme. I chose [Anatole](https://themes.gohugo.io/anatole/), but there were several to choose from.
3. Configure the [core repo](https://github.com/rjc123/robincarswell.com) in github.
4. Figure out hosting on [github pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)
5. Write this blog.
6. [Still to do] Get all the historical content in shape. No wonder I'm stalled here.
7. [Still to do] Set up the domain.

This post might seem pretty simplistic. It is. I'm really just writing this for one person, "Future Robin" -- because he's not as knowledgeable about what's going on here as I am.
